OVERVIEW
  - PFP is a downstream project to BRMS 5.3.* "Deployable"
  - purpose of PFP :
    - provide an example of one possible production BRMS environment using 
      BRMS deployable libraries


PFP github branches :
    - master
        - targets "domain" managed JBoss EAP6.1.* in local environment
        - targets 'standalone' EAP 6 in 'openshift' mode
        - leverages Red Hat/JBoss BRMS5.3.1 Deployable
        - configurable to use either mysql, oracle or postgres
        - leverages embedded hornetq provided by EAP 6
            - alternative is JBoss AMQ
        - pfp services implemented using CDI & JPA 2.1 with EJB 3.1 wrappings
        - provisions additional droolsjbpm web archives such as :
            1)  jboss-brms
            2)  web designer
            3)  business-central-server
            4)  business-central
        - provisioning scripts work only in a *nix variant (read: no windows)

    - 5.3.1_eap6.0
        - same as master branch however makes use of JBoss EAP6.0 rather than EAP6.1

    - 5.3.0.GA    
        - targeted for non-clustered JBoss EAP 5.*
        - tracks BRMS 5.3.* releases
        - pfp services implemented using EJB 3.0 and JPA 1.0 & MBeans
        - postgresql is the only database supported
        - provisioning scripts work on any operating system
        - requires separate 'standalone' hornetq 2.2.14 provider

    - 6.1.0
        - tracks Red Hat / JBoss BPMS6
        - used as one of the key components of:   "BPMS6 Engine" cartridge for Openshift

FEATURES 
1)  automated provisioning
    - Automates provisioning of BRMS deployable libraries on JBoss EAP in a *nix environment
    - Automates configuration of hornetq in ha clustered mode
    - Provides PostgreSQL, mysql and Oracle RDBMS configuration templates


2)  centralized configuration
    - centralized configuration of jbpm properties during build phase 
      - (via a single build.properties)
    - purpose
        - BRMS deployable has configuration files throughout it's various 
          sub-components
        - instead of manually modifying it's various config files, PFP allows
          the developer/admin to configure properties from a single properties
          file
          


3)  database integration
    - performance tested using postgresql
    - all jbpm / drools components now using one of 3 JCA connection pools:
        1)  jbpm-core-cp
        2)  jbpm-bam
        3)  guvnor-cp
    - centralized configuration for the following databases:
        1)  postgresql
        2)  mysql
        3)  oracle 11


4)  CDI singleton services
    - Exposes full functionality of BRMS APIs to remote clients
    - Allows for scalability / fail-over in distributed environment
    - Allows for wrapping with EJB, REST or SOAP endpoints
    - avoids management of jbpm/drools knowledge sessions in client code
    - simplifies usability of the jpm5 engine from the client perspective


5)  EJB wrappers of CDI singleton services
    - provides remote access to CDI singleton services
    - Allows for runtime configuration of JAAS policies
        - Authentication requirements
        - Method-level authorization
        - Programmatic authorization via SessionContext


6)  task functionality
    - No longer uses a Mina /Hornet-q messaging provider nor jbpm "Task Server"
    - instead, exposes task related API as EJB3
    - greatly simplifies environment
    - substantial performance and concurrency improvements 
    - leverages BRMS TaskServiceSession directly
    - BRMS human task functionality is centralized


7)  StatefulKnowledgeSession management:
    - drools/jbpm process engine functionality is centralized
    - forwards process engine BAM events to a messaging provider
    - significantly more performant than persisting BAM event to RDBMS in same
      thread of execution as process engine
    - two implementions:
        1)  SessionPerPInstance strategy
          - appropriate when bpmn2 definitions include rules nodes 
          - prevents optimistic lock exceptions that may occur in concurrent
            environments
          - recycles database SessionInfo records after process completion
            -prevents SessionInfo table from continuosly growing
        2)  SingleSessionForAll strategy
          - appropriate when bpmn2 definitions do not include rules nodes


8)  bam functionality
    - bam data maintains relationship between:
        parent process instances and its sub-process instances
    - this allows BAM reporting that can be depicted in a tree structure
    - within the BAM audit-trail tree structure, the BAM reports can be generated that include any human task variables that existed at that time
